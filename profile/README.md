## 🔬 Research Interests & Expertise

The **EpiPandit** lab utilizes data science to predict and prevent pandemic threats. Our work spans:

* **Infectious Disease Epidemiology:** Spillover dynamics at the animal-human interface and the impact of climate change.
* **Interpretable Machine Learning:** Developing mathematical models and diagnostic validation tools for population health.
* **One Health Surveillance:** Global health research focusing on emerging viral threats in low- and middle-income countries.

## 🛠 Active Projects & Platforms

### [🐾 WildAlert: Early Warning System]([https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/EpiPandit/WildAlert](https://wildalert.org/))
[WildAlert](https://wildalert.org/)  
A Wildlife Morbidity and Mortality Event Alert System.\\
The system contains integrated data entered in near real-time from a network of wildlife rehabilitation organizations across the United States. Use the dashboard to set up queries to visualize and receive notifications on wildlife morbidity and mortality events.

### [🌦 Arenavirus Climate Modeling]([https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/EpiPandit/Arenavirus-Climate](https://atlas-arena.org/))
[AtlasArena](https://atlas-arena.org/)  
AtlasArena is a Wellcome Trust-funded research project that aims to create and deploy climate-driven spatio-temporal disease ecology models that predict the risk of infections to humans from new world Arenaviruses. The platform uses Species Distribution Models (SDMs) to predict the geographical distribution of rodent reservoirs for zoonotic New World Arenaviruses, leveraging occurrence data, bioclimatic, vegetation, and land use datasets.
